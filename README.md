# DisChat
My submission for the T3 Chat Hackathon 2025!

💬 DisChat allows you to speak with multiple different models.

🌐 These models have access to the web for up-to-date information, and you can upload an image or PDF. 

🧑‍💻 Coding is also a core feature, allowing users to preview their code in some circumstances. Code blocks are minimized by default and can be expanded at any time. Logging in lets you sync your conversations across multiple devices, and Guest mode will only store conversations in LocalStorage.

# How to test.

1. Go to https://lasangainc.github.io/DisChat/
2. Log in with Google or continue as a guest.
3. Enter either a Groq API key or a OpenRouter API key.
4. Choose a model and go nuts!
